            <p class="product__description">
              Flywire was created by Jay Meschter, Director of Innovation at
              Nike. He began by taking a "last" (an object shaped like a foot
              used to design shoes) and marking the key points of where a shoe
              needs to support the foot.The goal of the design is to help and
              support the foot using the lightest and strongest material
              possible, Vectran. The Flywire design prevents the foot from
              slipping when running. Flywire is also a minimalist idea (the idea
              that items should only contain necessities), since the upper only
              contains the fundamental features. This allows the maximum amount
              of energy to be moved forward each stride

            <h3 class="product__title">Nike Air Max</h3>
            <p class="product__description">
              As the name indicates, all Air Max shoes feature one or more
              translucent pouches of pressurized gas embedded in the midsole and
              visible from the outside of the shoe. Referred to as "Air units"
              or "airbags," their stated purpose is to provide superior
              cushioning to traditional foam while also reducing weight. The
              effectiveness of the technology for this purpose is disputed;
              nevertheless, the shoes enjoy consistent popularity, especially
              among sneaker enthusiasts and collectors.

            <p class="product__description">
              Hoka shoes have a cushioned midsole that offers shock absorbency
              and added comfort to help protect your joints, "Meta-Rocker". The
              Meta-Rocker technology uses a low heel-to-toe drop — meaning the
              height difference between the heel and the ball of the feet is
              minimal — plus a rounded sole to help propel you forward. Hoka
              shoes retain features like a low weight-to-cushion ratio and
              midsole and outsole geometry designed to promote inherent
              stability and an efficient stride.

            <p class="product__description">
              Zoom Air made its original performance debut in three styles: the
              Nike Air Marauder football cleat, the Nike Air Go LWP basketball
              shoe, and soon after, the Nike Air Zoom LWP running shoe. Ever
              since, athletes have trained, competed and won in shoes featuring
              its responsive cushioning. Zoom Air technology is designed for
              athletes across multiple sports whose performance is based on
              speed. Whether that means an explosive drive, a powerful cut, or a
              lightning-quick change of direction. Zoom Air absorbs the forces
              applied to it by the fastest athletes in the world—and gives a
              little of it right back.

              The Nike Dunk is one of the most collectible silhouettes on the
              market today. Basketball shoe turned skateboarding staple, the
              Dunk has enjoyed a full-force revival in the year 2020 and 2021,
              surpassing its original purpose as a college hoop sneaker by a
              long shot. The Dunk is renowned for its incredible ability to
              unify art, fashion, music and popular culture into one seamless
              whole, consistently acting as a shoe for several subcultures
              worldwide.

            <p class="product__description">
              The Air Force 1 was produced in 1982 and discontinued in 1984. It
              was re-released in 1986 with the modern italic Nike logo with a
              Swoosh on the bottom on the back of the shoe. Little has changed
              to the Air Force One since its creation in 1982, although the
              original stitching on the side panels is no longer present in
              modern versions of the shoe. Since then, over 1,700 color
              variations have been produced, bringing in an estimated 800
              million USD/year in revenue. The selling of the Air Force Ones
              online by certain retailers used to be prohibited by Nike who had
              restricted supply of the sneaker. Nike now allows retailers to
              offer the shoe for sale online.

            <h3 class="product__title">Adidas Dragon</h3>
            <p class="product__description">
              It wasn't until the 70's, shortly before Adi's death, that the
              classic Adidas Dragon shoe was invented and released to the
              public. Perhaps one of the more overlooked classics in the Adidas
              repertoire, the retro Dragon is a little flatter and lighter than
              the other classics Adidas are known for shoes which often have a
              thicker, more cushioned sole and heavier upper lining. The Dragon
              stays true to form with the classic three stripe pattern; the
              vintage mark of Adidas quality which has been part and parcel of
              the company since its founding in 1949. However, it wasn't until
              the new millennium that the Dragons really spread their wings and
              soared to popularity eventually becoming a mainstay in popular
              culture.
